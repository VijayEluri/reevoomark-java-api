## Description

The ReevooMark-Java-Api is a Java tag library for ReevooMark customers who want to quickly and easily integrate Reevoo content into their sites server-side.

## Other Languages

Tag libraries are also available for [.NET](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-dotnet-api), [Ruby](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-ruby-api) and [PHP](https://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-php-api).

## Features

* Server-side inclusion of Reevoo content.
* Included CSS for display of Reevoo content.
* Server-side caching of content that respects the cache control rules set by Reevoo.
* Product and customer experience rating and conversation badges.
* Purchase tracking.

## Support

ReevooMark support can be obtained by emailing <operations@reevoo.com>.

There is also a [bug tracker](http://github.com/reevoo/reevoomark-java-api/issues) available.

## Installation

The easiest way to get the latest compiled version of the Reevoo taglib is to download it from sourceforge:

* Download the file from [sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/reevoomarkjavaapi/files/)
* Add this file to your projects classpath

If you use Maven for your project add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```XML
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.reevoo.taglib</groupId>
    <artifactId>reevoo-taglib</artifactId>
    <version>1.11</version>
  </dependency>
```

## Configuration

#### Global Tracking Reference

The different jsp tags allow you to explicitly specify your tracking reference (trkref) as an attribute every time you use one of them. But if you prefer, you can set the trkref value in a global property, in which case you would not have to specify it each time you use one of the jsp tags.

If you want to set the trkref value as a global property, you need to create a file named "reevooTablibConfig.properties" and place this file somewhere within you web application classpath. You can set your trkref value in a property within this file by the name "default.trkref".

For example, if your trkref is "REV" and you want to set it as a global property, create the "reevooTablibConfig.properties" file and add the following property to it.

```
  default.trkref=REV
```

Once you have done this, you can use the different jsp tags libraries without the need to specify the trkref attribute each time. For example you would use 

```JSP
  <reevoo:javascriptAssets/>
```

instead of

```JSP
  <reevoo:javascriptAssets trkref="REV"/>
```


#### Proxy Settings

To display embedded reviews, the tag library will need to make an httpClient request to our "mark.reevoo.com" domain from within your application server box. You need to make sure this domain is reachable from within the box. If you use a proxy you need to set the proxy host and port in the "reevooTaglibConfig.properties" file.

If you've already created the "reevooTaglibConfig.properties" file to add the "default.trkref" property as detailed in the previous section, then you just need to add the following two extra properties below. Otherwise if you had no created the file before just create it and add the two properties below. Make sure the file is added to the classpath of your web application.

```
  http.proxyHost=www.myproxyhost.com
  http.proxyPort=9999
``` 

Make sure to replace "www.myproxyhost.com" and "9999" for the real values of your proxy.

## Implementation

In any JSP page where you will be using Reevoo tags please ensure to include the taglib:

```JSP
  <%@ taglib prefix="reevoo" uri="http://reevoo.com/java-taglib/v1" %>
```

You should include the Reevoo specific CSS in your header using the tag below

```JSP
 <reevoo:cssAssets/>
```

You should include the Reevoo specific JavaScript **at the bottom of your body, just before closing the body tag**, using the tag below

```JSP
  <reevoo:javascriptAssets/>
```

As before you may set an explicit TRKREF if you wish.

```JSP
  <reevoo:javascriptAssets trkref="WAS" />
```

It also has support for multiple TRKREF'S.

```JSP
  <reevoo:javascriptAssets trkref="WAS,CYS,REV" />
```

### Generic Mark Embeddable Content Tag

There is a generic tag that allows to specify the base url to call on the Reevoo server for generic embeddable content that is
not provided by any of the previous tags. The tag name is "mark" and you can use it in the following way:

```JSP
  <reevoo:mark sku="<SKU>" trkref="<TRKREF>" baseURI="http://mark.reevoo.com/reevoomark/fr-FR/10/embeddable_reviews.html" />
```

### Rendering Issues

Any changes to the visibility settings of the 'traffic reviews solution' will require you to call the code below to
ensure the correct formatting is applied.

NOTE: This assumes you are using the latest version of the Reevoo JS library.

```Javascript
  ReevooMark.auto_scale()
```

## Tracking

If you display the reviews in a tabbed display, or otherwise require visitors to your site to click an element before
seeing the embedded reviews, add the following onclick attribute to track the clickthroughs:

```HTML
  onclick="ReevooMark.track_click_through(‘<SKU>’)”
```

### Purchase Tracking

If your site includes online shopping functionality add Reevoo's purchase tracking to your store by including the following tag in your "Order Confirmation Page":

``` html
<reevoo:purchaseTrackingEvent trkref="REV" skus="999,222,3373" value="342.00"/>
```

In the tag above:
* Make sure to replace the value of the "trkref" attribute with your own trkref.
* Replace the value of the "skus" attribute with a comma separated list of all the skus that have been purchased as part of the order.
* Replace the value of the "value" attribute with the total value of the order, you don't need to include currency symbol.

All this tracking information will be available to you on your Reevoo Analytics account.

### Propensity to Buy Tracking

This type of tracking is used as a substitute of purchase tracking, detailed in the section above, for retailers that do not offer online purchase in their stores and therefore do not have an order confirmation page.

These retailers can use <reevoo:propensityToBuyTrackingEvent>, which can be added to any page they wish on the site.

To add a propensity to buy event to a page use the following tag:

``` html
<reevoo:propensityToBuyTrackingEvent trkref="REV" action="Requested Brochure" sku="234"/>
```

In the tag above:
* Make sure to replace the value of the "trkref" attribute with your own trkref.
* Replace the value of the "action" attribute with a string desccribing the type of event that you want to track, can be anything you want like "user visited the buy now page" or "user requested brochure" or "user requested a test drive", etc...
* The "sku" attribute is optional, you only have to include it if you want to link the tracking event to a specific product sku, otherwise just leave it empty.

All this tracking information will be available to you on your Google Analitycs account.
